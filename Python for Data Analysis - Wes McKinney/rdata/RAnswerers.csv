2.  A traditional rule governing the case of personal pronouns after forms of the verb to be  is that the nominative or subjective form ( I; she; he; we; they ) must be chosen. Some 400 years ago, owing to the feeling that the postverb position in a sentence is object rather than subject territory, me  and other objective pronouns ( him; her; us; them ) began to replace the subjective forms after be,  so that It is I  became It is me.</p>

<p>Originally from Massachusetts, he stayed in the midwest after earning an undergrad degree in anthropology and biology from Grinnell.  After a few years of shovelbumming, he found himself in Milwaukee, with weak prospects.  After conning his way into a statistics job, and realizing that the people asking him for advice knew even less than he did about numbers, he decided to do the normal thing, and actually return to school, earning his M.S. from the U of Minnesota's School of Public Health's Division of Biostatistics in 2005.</p>

<p>From there, it's been up, up, up, including a stint at the U of M Epidemiology Department where he worked on statistical genetics and statistical simulation projects.</p>

<p>My answers/comments/opinions are my own fault entirely.</p>

<p>I enjoy being as pan-language, pan-platform, pan-paradigm as I can.</p>

<ul>
<li>Current main language: Powershell (for real--I never would have guessed
that I'd end up both using and liking this strange little language so much). It makes me like being in a Windows environment.</li>
<li>Current main language of aspiration/interest: Scala.</li>
<li>Current RDBMS: SQL Server 2008.  After being in the Open Source world and while still sharing an affinity for Open Source philosophies, I can finally admit: I'd much rather be on SQL Server than MySQL.  There, I said it.  I feel much better.</li>
</ul>

<p>I really like the interesting cross-over space of being on the data analytics side, but with an SD bent and background.  I get to deal with the challenges of big data and interpreting data meaningfully, while also having the SD background to build analysis tools and do significant DBA style work to make analysis of large data sets possible.</p>

<h2>On Down-voting</h2>

<p>
About two percent of my votes are down-votes, which I think is quite low. Down-voting is an important part of StackExchange and helps separate the good answers (and questions) from the not-so-good. If I have down-voted one of your posts, I will have left you a comment as to why. If you down-vote one of my posts, I ask that you, too, leave a comment as to why so that I can either improve my post or remove it. Thank you.

<h2>""Lloyd-Webber's awful stuff<br>

<p><p>About the avatar:
<p>It is in memory of 2 of the greatest geniuses of the 20th century (or perhaps in any century).  </p>

<p><p>1. Peter Sellers whose comic genius inspired a whole slew of successful comedians and what better accomplishment to leave to the world than laughter!!</p>

<p><p> 2.Stanley Kubrick whose films have been both iconoclastic and <b>profoundly humanistic</b> (I think some may have missed this point).  I believe his crowning achievement is in fact <b>Dr. Strangelove</b> who is pictured in the avatar.  A dark comedy (but with very serious overtones) about the ease with which the human species can eradicate itself.  If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it RIGHT NOW!</p>

My experience and interests are in applied computing: large, complex systems; performance-sensitive computing; signal-processing; scientific/numerical computing.  My primary language is c++, although I use only a subset of the available features; I am somewhat worried about the direction c++ is taking, most of the new and proposed features do not solve any of my day-to-day needs.  Recently I picked up Python and C#, I like both.  I am an admirer of Anders Hejlsberg: TurboPascal, Delphi and C#/DotNet are all fine pieces of work.</p>

Since these tools are what I live and breathe, most of what I have say that is constructive is thus unwanted.  So, I expect to respond to further questions at likely a far lower rate.</p>

<p><em>If you think, as I do, that Stack Overflow is about providing good answers regardless of who provides them, you can take up that case in Meta.</em>  In the meantime, mostly I expect to be absent from SO.</p>

I'm a principal at Semantic Designs.  Many of my answers point to tools or products of SD, many of which I have a direct role in engineering; its what I know intimately.  When I provide such answers, I try to make sure that the answer is relevant to the specific question being asked. YMMV.

<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>I am a self-taught programmer mainly involved in <strong>PHP, MySQL, CSS/HTML, JavaScript/jQuery</strong> for around 4 years now. I have also worked with ASP 3.0, Java and PERL quite a bit. I like to code and develop in accordance with XHTML/CSS/Web standards, validated and cross-browser ready sites. I simply love PHP, JavaScript, JQuery and CSS. I  like to use state-of-the-art tools and techs and keep myself updated with latest stuff and am therefore always keen to learn new things and gain more and more knowledge because the thirst is <em>never</em> satisfied :)</p>

<p>I have always used very specialised automatic test equipment, which gives me an unusual perspective on how to solve software problems (usually <em>by myself</em> without recourse to libraries and frameworks). This is definitely <strong>not</strong> mainstream, but I don't create <em>commercial</em> software: my user-base is my fellow employees.</p>

<p>My contributions to SO probably seem <em>other-worldly</em>, but the programming environments I've used have never been Windows-based and only vaguely Unix-like.</p>

<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong> &#8212; In late February 2010, I was admitted to hospital with a suspected stroke. Tests showed it wasn't a stroke, it is <em>Multiple Sclerosis</em>. Thus begins an inevitable slide into disability.</p>

<p>While I'm now back at work, hopefully for a few more years, I think the effort of engaging in SO (after a lull of over 12 months) might be too much for me. Besides, I can't type as fast as I used to.</p>

<p>My neurologist made the disturbing comment that I may have lost some mental faculties and be unaware of it, so my presence on SE websites will serve to test whether my brain still works.</p>

I use my own build of Python that is portable (to Linux OSes) and entirely self-contained.</p>

<p>Lately I've been coding an application and some tools that make use of AMQP messaging, in particular using RabbitMQ as the MQ Broker. I am very impressed at how AMQP, combined with network db APIs, lets you build an application in many small decoupled components that can easily be scaled on one or many servers.</p>

<p>Since RabbitMQ is implemented in Erlang, I learned enough Erlang to make a simple management app that runs on an independent Erlang node, i.e. not a RabbitMQ plugin. And since my company's main language is Java, I am now learning Scala (with Akka actors) since this JVM language has part of its heritage in Erlang.</p>

<p>I also like to apply programming to fiddle with new ideas in other fields.

<p>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.</p>

<p>Credo:</p>

<p>""The simple, elegant and versatile system must offer expedience where practical, but expedience can and will be sacrificed in favour of any of the above. It must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized. When expedience is compromised by a resulting complexity of user interface, it must present its complexity without unnecessary complication. All other principles must be sacrificed in favour of design simplicity. Implementation simplicity is more important than interface simplicity.""</p>

<p>I work for <a href=""http://www.2ndquadrant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">2nd Quadrant</a>, a global PostgreSQL consultancy.</p>

<p>I maintain a technical blog at <a href=""http://blog.ringerc.id.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">blog.ringerc.id.au</a>. My PostgreSQL writing now appears on the <a href=""http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">2nd quadrant blog</a>.</p>

<p>I'll work in most programming languages with varying degrees of competence, though I'll only reluctantly touch PHP or Perl code. I'm more interested in the libraries, tools, and the code that's built on top of the language.</p>

<p>Most of my scrap code lives on <a href=""https://github.com/ringerc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ringerc</a> . Most of my open source code is in the form of scattered patches across too many different bugzillas and JIRAs, rather than single new projects. Over time I've done a lot of work on Scribus and PoDoFo, but have moved away from both projects as my focus and interests changed. I contribute patches - rather infrequently - to PostgreSQL and to various Java EE 6 infrastructure components. Most of my contribution is now non-code, in the form of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detailed bug reporting with test cases, which I spend an unpleasant proportion of my development time preparing and submitting, mostly against JBoss and java.net projects.</li>
<li>User support for PostgreSQL on mailing lists and here on SE</li>
<li>PostgreSQL patch review and beta testing</li>
<li>Usability review of Java EE libs/tools, as well as usability review of PostgreSQL and its tools</li>
<li>Writing, editing and enhancing documentation, HOWTOs, etc</li>
<li><a href=""http://blog.ringerc.id.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">Blogging in detail</a> on topics likely to be useful to others.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've turned into a git fiend and no longer understand why anybody uses anything else. I'm also becoming increasingly obsessive about testing, particularly with the advent of <a href=""http://jenkins-ci.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Jenkins CI</a> and <a href=""http://arquillian.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Arquillian</a>.</p>

My knowledge of programming is very tiny and limited only to digital interfaces we interact with as humans or more simply as living mammals.</p>

<p>However, recently I have found out that skilled programming techniques not only are helpful in areas of websites, but <em>also</em> in game design, game interiors, realworld architecture, urbanism, flow controll of hydraulics, balloon flights... and even in designing public parks that interact with humans! The unique outcomes of such projects fascinates me daily.</p>

<p>Contact me for openminded Architectural Projects, where programmers could automate ideas and stuff in refreshing ways.</p>

My clients included Fortune 500 manufacturers, law firms, and non-profit organizations. I've worked with SQL databases since 1985.  I'm a database generalist; I'm comfortable with any modern SQL dbms. My home server runs a half-dozen different database management systems. I test most of my answers under more than one of them.</p>

<p>I've also developed relational models for implementation in non-SQL environments, like Lotus Notes and plain C++ code.</p>

<p>I'm known for frequently saying </p>

<ul>
<li>ID numbers have nothing to do with normalization.</li>
<li>Everything you know about state codes is wrong.</li>
<li>Table names, column names, etc., are your database's API.</li>
<li>Natural keys reduce the number of joins, and often improve performance.</li>
<li>Don't assume. Test.</li>

Well, let's say starting then I always tried to expand my knowledge. While I still am not a typical wizard at some topic, I believe I have collected a fair amount of knowledge over various areas. </p>

<p>These includes all of the three major desktop operating systems being used those days (with Windows being the least favored one and all Linux distributions counted as one single systems), as well as quite a lot of programming languages. </p>

<p>In my later years I decided to study mathematics, which helped me to sharpen my logical reasoning and develop a toolset of problem solving methods.</p>

<p>In 2011 I finished my M. Sc. in Maths and started working as a data- and process analyst at one of Germany's major companies. </p>

<p>In parallel I am working part-time on my PhD, researching one practical application for B-Splines and the methods that can be used for that. </p>

<p>Right now the languages and applications I use frequently are MATLAB, R and C++, as well as LaTeX, if one wants to call that a programming language (well, it's Turing-complete, isn't it?). Furthermore, I started getting used to Emacs and loving it - here, though, I'm only scratching on the surface.</p>

I am also a certified PMP as well.  I enjoy new opportunities and experiences.  Right now I am located in Pennsylvania but I would love to move south someday soon.</p>

<p>I have spent most of my time in the Microsoft stack (starting with VBA and VB6 as well as SQL Server 7).  I moved to .NET when it came out and Microsoft SQL Server has always been my primary database platform.  However, I have developed applications professionally in a number of languages including PHP, C++, C, Powershell, etc.</p>

<p>Right now I am working through both WCF and WPF.  On the Microsoft SQL side, I am spending a lot of time in the Query editor window but I do spend time working with SSIS as well.</p>

<p>If I had to pick one thing I was best at, I would say that it is probably identifying solutions to problems, even if those problems haven't been identified as problems.  I am skilled at deconstructing issues and identifying a good path to solve each issue on the way to solving the entire problem.  This serves me well in software development but it also applies to a lot of non-development areas.  That is why currently I am a certified project manager and the head of an IT department.  I find problems and I solve them.  I have been able to be creative in how I solved networking problems, server problems, and other IT-related problems.  This has given me great success in my many different roles over the years and it has given me a broad base of experiences to help improve my analytical abilities.</p>

<p>I love to hear from people, so feel free to give me a shout.  My email address is listed.  Drop me a line and say hi.</p>

I am interested in computational physics and like to write code.  I am also an avid gnuplot user.  To learn python I wrote a wrapper/interface around gnuplot called pygnuplot (Note, not gnuplot-py).  It is available on sourceforge.  If you're interested in using it, let me know and I'll try to help.</p>

<p>I would really like to earn a silver gnuplot badge so upvote my gnuplot answers if you think they're worthwhile  ;-)</p>

His awarded PhD research aims to explain relationships in tourism supply chain via lens of transaction cost economics using a statistical technique called structural equation model (SEM). He was awarded an MSc (distinction) in Logistics and Operations Management from Cardiff University in 2009. His studies in Cardiff have been fully supported by the Royal Thai Governments scholarship, which was awarded from a national competition. In 2005, he got a Bachelor of Economics (First-class honour) from Chiang Mai University (Thailand). Pairach has involved in a number of research projects in tourism economics and logistics as well as consultancy works to various organisations such as The World Bank and Thailand Ministry of Tourism and Sports. He is also an ad-hoc reviewer for several journals and conferences such as European Journal of Operational Research International Journal of Service Industry Management, Academy of Management Conference, and British Academy of Management Conference. His underlying research theme is an application of economics theories and techniques to logistics and supply chain management.</p>

<p>I have learned VBA at my bachelor, which was also were I discovered that I like programming. I like when I get the feeling that I am creating something. I realize that I am moving away from my education, as marketing in the real world is just as much about trading and advertising as it is about clustering consumer groups and what follows. I also like to help people, and i believe that people make each-other stronger if they stay honest to each-other as well as their common and individual goals.</p>

<p>If I can become skilled within quantitative analysis and at the same time have the fundamental theoretical understanding of consumers and economy, I believe I have a strong card at my hand. </p>
